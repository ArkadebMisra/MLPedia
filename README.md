# MLPedia

MLpedia is supposed to be a ML playground. the web application can apply various ML algorithms to simple data and saved the learned models to database. users can later use this database. There are also data visualization tools available too.

# How to use
I have to say even though I am quite happy with the project, it is very counter intutive and it does not have lot of guidance in how to use it. hence this section. 

*  The **plotter** section has some very simple plotting tools. which are farely self explanatory. you can understand very easily what to do by looking at the forms. The only important thing to here is how to enter the **X values** and **Y values** . Enter same number of data points in both the field and make sure they are **comma seperated** with a **single space after each comma**. as an example consider the following,  also added a screenshot- </br>

**Line1 X values: 5, 10, 15, 20**</br>
**Line1 Y values: 17, 23, 5, 10**</br>

* To use the **Analytica** section first go ahed and make an account. this step is necessary if you want to use the analytica section of the application
